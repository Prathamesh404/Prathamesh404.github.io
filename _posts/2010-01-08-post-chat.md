List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.

**1. Normal Method**

```python
squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)
# >>>squares
# [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

**2. List Comprehension**
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

**3.Nested List Comprehensions**

- Initiate the 2-D List or a Matrix

```python
matrix = [
     [1, 2, 3, 4],
     [5, 6, 7, 8],
     [9, 10, 11, 12],
 ]
```

- The following list comprehension will transpose rows and column

```python 
a = [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)]
# a = [[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]
```
